\chapter{Introduction}

We formalize the Simon--Smith min--max construction of minimal surfaces in closed $3$-manifolds.
Our main result follows Theorem~1.6 in Colding--de Lellis:
\begin{quote}
\emph{For any saturated set of generalized families of surfaces $\Lambda$, there exists a min--max sequence obtained from $\Lambda$ converging in the varifold sense to a smooth embedded minimal surface of area $m_0(\Lambda)$ (multiplicity allowed).}
\end{quote}
