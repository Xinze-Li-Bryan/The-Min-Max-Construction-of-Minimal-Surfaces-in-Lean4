# Min-Max Construction of Minimal Surfaces

A formalization of the Colding-De Lellis paper "The min-max construction of minimal surfaces" in Lean 4.

## Main Goal

Formalize **Theorem 1.6 (Simon-Smith)**: 
> Let M be a closed 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. For any saturated set of generalized families of surfaces Î›, there is a minâ€“max sequence obtained from Î› and converging in the sense of varifolds to a smooth embedded minimal surface with area mâ‚€(Î›).

## Project Structure
