# The Min-Max Construction of Minimal Surfaces in Lean4

A formalization of the Colding-De Lellis paper "The min-max construction of minimal surfaces" in Lean 4.

## Main Goal

Formalize **Theorem 1.6 (Simon-Smith)**:
> Let M be a closed 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. For any saturated set of generalized families of surfaces Î›, there is a minâ€“max sequence obtained from Î› and converging in the sense of varifolds to a smooth embedded minimal surface with area mâ‚€(Î›) (multiplicity is allowed).

## Project Structure

```bash
MinimalSurfaces/
â”œâ”€â”€ Basic.lean              - Basic definitions of manifolds and surfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ Varifolds/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Basic.lean         - Varifold theory (Geometric Measure Theory)
â”œâ”€â”€ MinMax/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Basic.lean         - Min-max theory and main theorem
â””â”€â”€ Convergence/
    â””â”€â”€ Basic.lean         - Convergence theory in varifold sense
```

## Key Concepts to Formalize

### âœ… Completed (Framework)

- Closed Riemannian 3-manifolds (`ClosedRiemannian3Manifold`)
- Embedded surfaces (`EmbeddedSurface`)
- Varifolds structure (`Varifold`, `IntegerVarifold`)
- Generalized families of surfaces (`GeneralizedFamily`)
- Saturated sets (`SaturatedSet`)
- Min-max sequences (`MinMaxSequence`)
- Basic theorem statement (`simon_smith`)

### ðŸš§ In Progress

- Area functional implementation using Hausdorff measure
- Mean curvature definition
- Varifold convergence precise definition
- Saturated set properties

### ðŸ“‹ TODO

- First and second fundamental forms
- Regularity theory
- Compactness theorems
- Generic finiteness results
- Multiplicity one theorem

## Mathematical Components

### Geometric Measure Theory

- **Varifolds**: Radon measures on Grassmann bundles
- **Integer rectifiable varifolds**: With multiplicity functions
- **Mass functional**: Generalization of area

### Min-Max Theory

- **Sweep-outs**: 1-parameter families of surfaces
- **Width**: inf-sup of area over families
- **Saturation**: Closure under homotopies

### Convergence Theory

- **Varifold convergence**: Weak-* convergence of measures
- **Regularity**: From varifolds to smooth surfaces
- **Compactness**: Existence of convergent subsequences
